        I am a very dedicated and determined individual, and I am very happy to work hard. For example, I am a dedicated guitarist and saxophonist, and practice both regularly. I am also enthusiastic about everything I take part in, and I will always try to achieve my full potential in whatever I may be doing. I am always eager to assist others in any way necessary, and will go out of my own way to help people. I work quickly and efficiently, making sure to do an exceptional job whilst not taking an excessive amount of time to do it. I enjoy interacting with others, and come across as a very friendly and welcoming person.
